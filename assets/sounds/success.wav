As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate audio files like "success.wav". However, you can create or download a .wav file and name it "success.wav", then place it in the "assets/sounds/" directory. This file will be used to play a sound when the user successfully hits the target in the Mouse Accuracy Test application.
