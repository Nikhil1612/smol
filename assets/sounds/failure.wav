As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate audio files like "failure.wav". However, you can create or download a .wav file and name it "failure.wav", then place it in the "assets/sounds" directory. This file will be used to play a sound when the user misses the target in the Mouse Accuracy Test application.
