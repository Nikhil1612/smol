1. "src/main.py" and "src/mouse_test.py" - These files will share the "MouseTest" class which will contain methods for starting the test, tracking mouse movements, and ending the test. They will also share the "start_test" and "end_test" function names.

2. "src/mouse_test.py" and "src/results.py" - These files will share the "Results" class which will contain methods for calculating and displaying the results. They will also share the "calculate_results" and "display_results" function names.

3. "src/user_interface.py" and "src/main.py" - These files will share the "UserInterface" class which will contain methods for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions. They will also share the "display_ui" and "handle_user_interaction" function names.

4. "src/config.py" - This file will export configuration variables such as "TARGET_SIZE", "TEST_DURATION", and "CURSOR_SIZE" which will be shared by all other Python files.

5. "assets/images/cursor.png" and "assets/images/target.png" - These image files will be used by the "UserInterface" class in "src/user_interface.py" to display the cursor and target.

6. "assets/sounds/click.wav", "assets/sounds/success.wav", and "assets/sounds/failure.wav" - These sound files will be used by the "MouseTest" class in "src/mouse_test.py" to play sounds when the mouse is clicked, when the target is hit, and when the target is missed.

7. "tests/test_mouse_test.py", "tests/test_user_interface.py", "tests/test_results.py", and "tests/test_config.py" - These test files will share the "TestMouseTest", "TestUserInterface", "TestResults", and "TestConfig" classes respectively, which will contain unit tests for the corresponding classes in the main application. They will also share the "run_tests" function name.

8. DOM Elements - The "UserInterface" class in "src/user_interface.py" will use the id names "cursor", "target", and "results" to manipulate these elements in the user interface.

9. Message Names - The "MouseTest" class in "src/mouse_test.py" will use the message names "start_test", "end_test", "hit_target", and "miss_target" to communicate with the "UserInterface" class in "src/user_interface.py".
